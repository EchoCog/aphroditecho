# Development Environment Setup

This guide helps developers set up their environment for contributing to the Deep Tree Echo system.

## Development Setup

### 1. Environment Preparation

The system is designed for Replit development. Key directories:

```
├── echo.dash/          # Main dashboard (Python/FastAPI)
├── echo.dream/         # Visual interface (Python/Flask)
├── echo.self/          # Self-modification (TypeScript/React)
├── echo.kern/          # Core kernel (C/C++)
├── echo.files/         # File management utilities
├── aphrodite/          # AI engine integration
└── tests/              # Test suites
```

### 2. Language-Specific Setup

#### Python Components
- Uses FastAPI, Flask, and various ML libraries
- Virtual environments not needed in Replit
- Dependencies managed through requirements files

#### TypeScript/JavaScript Components
- Node.js and npm/yarn for package management
- React for frontend interfaces
- Modern ES6+ features

#### C/C++ Components
- GCC/Clang compiler support
- CMake for build configuration
- CUDA support for GPU acceleration

### 3. Development Workflow

#### Code Organization
- Modular architecture with clear separation
- Each `echo.*` directory is a distinct component
- Shared utilities in common directories

#### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for cross-component functionality
- End-to-end tests for user workflows

#### Version Control
- Git-based workflow
- Feature branches for development
- Pull requests for code review

## Key Development Areas

### 1. Dashboard Development (`echo.dash/`)
- FastAPI backend with async support
- Jinja2 templates for server-side rendering
- WebSocket support for real-time updates

### 2. Dream Interface (`echo.dream/`)
- Flask-based visualization system
- D3.js for interactive diagrams
- WebGL for 3D visualizations

### 3. Self-Modification System (`echo.self/`)
- React-based frontend
- TypeScript for type safety
- Real-time system monitoring

### 4. Core Kernel (`echo.kern/`)
- Low-level C/C++ implementation
- Memory management and optimization
- Hardware acceleration support

## Development Tools

### Code Quality
- ESLint/Prettier for JavaScript/TypeScript
- Black/isort for Python formatting
- clang-format for C/C++ code

### Debugging
- Built-in browser developer tools
- Python debugger integration
- GDB for C/C++ debugging

### Performance Monitoring
- Built-in profiling tools
- Memory usage tracking
- Performance metrics dashboard

## Contributing Guidelines

### Code Standards
- Follow established coding conventions
- Write comprehensive tests
- Document public APIs
- Include performance considerations

### Submission Process
1. Create feature branch
2. Implement changes with tests
3. Update documentation
4. Submit pull request
5. Address review feedback

### Testing Requirements
- All new features must include tests
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Performance tests for critical paths
- Integration tests for API changes
