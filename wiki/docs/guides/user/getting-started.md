# Getting Started

Welcome to the Deep Tree Echo system! This guide will help you get up and running quickly.

## Prerequisites

- Access to a Replit environment with the Deep Tree Echo system
- Basic understanding of neural-symbolic AI concepts
- Familiarity with web interfaces

## First Steps

### 1. Accessing the System

The Deep Tree Echo system is accessible through multiple interfaces:

- **Echo Dash**: Main dashboard interface (`echo.dash/`)
- **Echo Dream**: Visual exploration tool (`echo.dream/`)
- **Echo Self**: Self-modification interface (`echo.self/`)

### 2. Basic Navigation

The system uses a modular architecture with several key components:

- **Dashboard**: Overview of system status and quick actions
- **Memory Explorer**: Browse and search system memory
- **Architecture Viewer**: Examine system architecture
- **Configuration**: System settings and preferences

### 3. Your First Session

1. Open the main dashboard
2. Explore the memory interface
3. Try a simple query or interaction
4. Review the system's response and reasoning

## Key Features

### Memory Integration
The system maintains persistent memory across sessions, allowing for continuous learning and adaptation.

### Neural-Symbolic Processing
Combines neural network processing with symbolic reasoning for enhanced capabilities.

### Self-Modification
The system can adapt and evolve its own architecture based on experience.

## Next Steps

- Read the [Basic Operations](basic-operations.md) guide
- Explore the [API Integration](../dev/api-integration.md) documentation
- Check out the [Feature Overview](../../features/) for detailed component information
