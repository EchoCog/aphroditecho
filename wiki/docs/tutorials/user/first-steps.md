# First Steps Tutorial

This tutorial walks you through your first interaction with the Deep Tree Echo system.

## Overview

In this tutorial, you'll:
1. Access the main dashboard
2. Explore the interface
3. Perform your first query
4. Understand the response structure
5. Save and retrieve memories

## Step 1: Accessing the Dashboard

1. Navigate to the main dashboard interface
2. You should see the Echo Dashboard welcome screen
3. Take note of the main navigation areas:
   - **Memory Explorer**: Access system memory
   - **Architecture View**: System structure visualization
   - **Configuration**: Settings and preferences
   - **Activity Log**: Recent system activity

## Step 2: Interface Exploration

### Memory Explorer
The Memory Explorer allows you to:
- Browse existing memories
- Search for specific content
- View memory relationships
- Add new memories

### Architecture View
The Architecture View shows:
- System component structure
- Data flow diagrams
- Performance metrics
- Component relationships

## Step 3: Your First Query

Let's start with a simple query:

1. Navigate to the Memory Explorer
2. In the search box, type: "What is the Deep Tree Echo system?"
3. Press Enter or click Search
4. Observe the system's response

The system will:
- Process your query through multiple layers
- Search relevant memories
- Generate a comprehensive response
- Show the reasoning process

## Step 4: Understanding Responses

System responses include:
- **Direct Answer**: The main response to your query
- **Reasoning Chain**: Step-by-step thought process
- **Source Memories**: References to relevant stored information
- **Confidence Metrics**: System confidence in the response

## Step 5: Memory Management

### Saving Important Information
1. When you receive a useful response, click "Save to Memory"
2. Add tags or categories for easy retrieval
3. The system will integrate this into its knowledge base

### Retrieving Saved Information
1. Use the Memory Explorer search function
2. Browse by categories or tags
3. View memory connections and relationships

## Next Steps

After completing this tutorial:
- Try more complex queries
- Explore the architectural visualization
- Experiment with different query types
- Learn about advanced memory techniques in the [Memory Navigation](memory-navigation.md) tutorial

## Tips for Success

- **Be Specific**: More detailed queries often yield better results
- **Use Context**: Reference previous interactions when relevant
- **Explore Connections**: Follow memory links to discover related information
- **Save Frequently**: Build up your personal knowledge base over time
