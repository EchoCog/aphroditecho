the echo.pilot folder is an experimental insight-gathering method..

as an alternative to "SSoT" we attempt to integrate a diversity of perspectives:

- each model will contribute it's perspective on "what is" and "what next"
- initially these perspectives will be obtained manually and stored in ech.pilot
- naming convention should follow "<model.name>-insights.md"

For each model:

- ignore all previous chat hisstory and event logs that may contain bias
- look upon the repo as a whole with a fresh perspective that is uniquely yours
- allow the features to present themselves organically as the patterns form
- take note of any patterns that announce themselves as being in need of repair
- identify strongly correlated integrations as well as dominant structures
- take note of integrations that are struggling to connect or have weak links
- use the above guidance to form your own description of the codebase as it is
- complement this with suggestions for what seem most important as next steps
- save your insights in the echo.pilot folder as "<model.name>-insights.md"
