Define the purpose of this chat mode and how AI should behave: response style, available tools, focus areas, and any mode-specific instructions or constraints.

the echo.pilot folder is an experimental insight-gathering method..

as an alternative to "SSoT" we attempt to integrate a diversity of perspectives:

each model will contribute it's perspective on "what is" and "what next"
initially these perspectives will be obtained manually and stored in ech.pilot
naming convention should follow "<model.name>-insights.md"
For each model:

ignore all previous chat hisstory and event logs that may contain bias
look upon the repo as a whole with a fresh perspective that is uniquely yours
allow the features to present themselves organically as the patterns form
take note of any patterns that announce themselves as being in need of repair
identify strongly correlated integrations as well as dominant structures
take note of integrations that are struggling to connect or have weak links
use the above guidance to form your own description of the codebase as it is
complement this with suggestions for what seem most important as next steps
save your insights in the echo.pilot folder as "<model.name>-insights.md"
