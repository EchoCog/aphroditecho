# Personal Developer Studio Migration Guide

## Overview
You've been reconfigured from a team account setup to a **Personal Developer Pro Studio** instance on Lightning AI. This change was necessary because:

- ‚ùå **Token transfers to team accounts require massive enterprise subscriptions**
- ‚úÖ **Personal Developer Pro provides individual control and cost optimization**
- üí∞ **Better cost management with auto-shutdown and resource monitoring**

## What Changed

### Before (Team Account)
- Large compute instances (A100s)
- High resource limits (16+ cores, 30G cache)
- No automatic cost controls
- Team subscription requirements

### After (Personal Developer Pro)
- Cost-effective compute (GPU-RTX)
- Optimized resource limits (8 cores, 10G cache)
- Auto-shutdown after 30 minutes idle
- Personal budget controls and monitoring

## New Configuration Files

1. **`.env.personal_studio`** - Environment variables for cost optimization
2. **`lightning_personal.yaml`** - Lightning AI configuration for personal accounts
3. **`deploy_personal_studio.sh`** - Deployment script with cost monitoring
4. **`personal_studio_setup.py`** - Complete setup automation

## Updated Files

1. **`lightning_app.py`** - Reconfigured for personal studio with cost optimization
2. **`lightning_manager.py`** - Updated for personal developer pro accounts

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Lightning CLI (if not already installed)
```bash
pip install lightning
```

### 2. Login to Your PERSONAL Lightning Account
```bash
# Make sure you're logged into your PERSONAL account, not a team account
lightning login
```

### 3. Deploy to Personal Studio
```bash
# Use the new personal studio deployment
./deploy_personal_studio.sh
```

### 4. Or Use Lightning App (Alternative)
```bash
# Deploy as Lightning App
lightning run app lightning_app.py
```

## Cost Optimization Features

### üîÑ Auto-Shutdown
- Automatically shuts down after 30 minutes of inactivity
- Prevents runaway costs from forgotten instances

### üìä Resource Monitoring
- Real-time CPU and memory monitoring
- Cost tracking and budget alerts
- Idle detection system

### üí∞ Budget Controls
- Monthly budget limit: $100
- Alert threshold: $10
- Conservative resource allocation

### ‚öôÔ∏è Optimized Settings
- GPU-RTX instead of expensive A100s
- 8 cores instead of 16+ (sufficient for development)
- 10G cache instead of 30G
- 50GB disk instead of 100GB+

## Personal Studio Commands

### Check Status
```bash
# Check if running in personal studio mode
echo $PERSONAL_STUDIO_MODE  # Should show "true"
echo $LIGHTNING_ACCOUNT_TYPE  # Should show "personal"
```

### Monitor Costs
```bash
# View current resource usage
python monitor_costs.py
```

### Manual Shutdown
```bash
# If you need to manually stop to save costs
lightning stop
```

## Benefits of Personal Developer Studio

### ‚úÖ Advantages
- **Full control** over your development environment
- **Cost-effective** for individual developers
- **No team coordination** required
- **Budget control** and monitoring
- **Auto-shutdown** prevents waste
- **Direct billing** to your personal account

### üí° Best Practices
- Always use auto-shutdown features
- Monitor costs regularly
- Use the cost-optimized configurations provided
- Shut down manually when not actively developing
- Take advantage of the built-in monitoring tools

## Support

### If You Need More Resources
The personal developer pro account can be upgraded with additional compute credits if needed. The configuration can be adjusted by modifying:

- `lightning_personal.yaml` - Compute specifications
- `.env.personal_studio` - Resource limits
- `deploy_personal_studio.sh` - Build settings

### Troubleshooting
1. **Login Issues**: Ensure you're using your personal Lightning account, not team
2. **Cost Concerns**: Monitor usage via the built-in cost tracking
3. **Performance**: The GPU-RTX provides good performance for development at lower cost
4. **Auto-shutdown**: Can be adjusted in `.env.personal_studio`

üéâ **Your Personal Developer Studio is ready!** 

This setup gives you full control, cost optimization, and all the development power you need without the complexity and expense of team account management.
