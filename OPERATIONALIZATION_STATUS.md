2. **Gateway Enhancement**
   - Add gRPC support
   - Implement authentication/authorization
   - Add rate limiting

### Phase 2: Observability (Week 3-4)
1. **Tracing Integration**
   - OpenTelemetry span generation
   - Correlation ID propagation
   - Performance metrics collection

2. **Policy Engine**
   - Safety class enforcement
   - Cost budget management

## üîç Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Cross-language compatibility**: Need to ensure consistent behavior across Python, Rust, Go
- **Performance regression**: Must maintain <5% latency overhead target
- **Data migration**: Legacy system data must be preserved during transition

### Medium Risk
- **Schema evolution**: Contract changes must maintain backward compatibility
- **Resource scaling**: Memory and arena management under high load
- **Integration complexity**: Multiple subsystems must work together seamlessly

### Low Risk
- **Unit testing**: Comprehensive test coverage already in place
- **Documentation**: Well-documented APIs and interfaces
- **Error handling**: Robust error handling in all components

## üìà Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] All AAR components achieve <5% latency overhead
- [ ] 95%+ test coverage maintained
- [ ] Zero critical security vulnerabilities
